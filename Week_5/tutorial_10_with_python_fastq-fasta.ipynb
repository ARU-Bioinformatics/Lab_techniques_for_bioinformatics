        "The lecture notes give several different examples of how Unix commands can be used to convert between flat files. However, ideally we would want to be able to achieve this in Python. Below is an exemplar piece of Python code designed for a Jupyter Notebook. This code converts a FASTQ file to a FASTA file, a common task in bioinformatics for manipulating sequence data files. FASTQ files are used for storing biological sequences (typically nucleotide sequences) along with their quality scores, whereas FASTA files store just the sequence identifiers and the sequences themselves without any quality score information.\n",
